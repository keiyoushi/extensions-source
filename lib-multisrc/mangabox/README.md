## FAQ

#### What do `Page list is empty` and `Source URL has changed` mean?
The former **Mangabox** extensions have created new entries for many of the manga on their websites. The old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/) the manga from the source to itself to get the new entry, or better yet, to a different source entirely to avoid similar errors in the future.
