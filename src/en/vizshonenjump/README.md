## FAQ

### Why are some chapters missing?

**VIZ Shonen Jump** and **VIZ Manga** are paid subscription-based services and you need an active monthly subscription to
be able to read most of the chapters available in their service. These locked chapters will be
filtered out from the chapter list by default if you're not signed in. To sign in with
your existing account, follow the guide available below.

## Guides

### Reading subscription-locked chapters

The **VIZ** sources allows the reading of paid chapters if you have
an active paid subscription on their service.

> **Warning**
> Although the extension supports sign in and reading subscription-locked chapters,
> it's more a convenience. **We are not responsible if your account get banned** or something
> related, as using other clients that are not their official app or website goes against
> their Terms of Service. **It's recommended to use their official app or website instead**,
> use this feature in the extension at your own risk.

Follow the following steps to be able to sign in and get access to the locked chapters:

1. Open the popular or latest section of the source.
2. Open the WebView by clicking the button with a globe icon.
3. Do the login with your existing account *(read the observations section)*.
4. Close the WebView and refresh the chapter list of the titles
   you want to read the already paid chapters.

#### Observations

- You may sometime face the *"Your session has expired"* error. To fix it,
  you just need to open the WebView, await for the website to completely load and
  sign in again if you're not logged anymore. After that, you can close the
  WebView and try again.
- The extension **will not** bypass any payment requirement. You still do need
  to have an active paid subscription to be able to read the locked chapters.
