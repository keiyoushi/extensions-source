# Usage

[Getting started](https://keiyoushi.github.io/docs/guides/getting-started#adding-the-extension-repo)

# Requests

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions-source/issues/new/choose).

Please note that creating an issue does not mean that the source will be added or fixed in a timely
fashion, because the work is volunteer-based. Some sources may also be impossible to do or prohibitively
difficult to maintain.

If you would like to see a request fulfilled and have the necessary skills to do so, consider contributing!
Issues are up-for-grabs for any developer if there is no assigned user already.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Check out the repo's [issue backlog](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions-source/issues) for source requests and bug reports.
